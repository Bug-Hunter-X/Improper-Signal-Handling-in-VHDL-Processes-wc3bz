This repository demonstrates a common VHDL coding error related to signal assignment within processes.  The `bug.vhdl` file contains code with an improper signal handling that causes unexpected output. The corrected version is found in `bugSolution.vhdl`. The primary issue is the lack of proper signal updates within the process; signals in VHDL do not update instantaneously.  The corrected solution uses appropriate signal assignments.
